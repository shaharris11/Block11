                My human name was Satoru Mokami. I was a 37 year old man working are a general contractor and I never even had a girlfriend. Never even went on a date, yup i died a virigin. But i bet you are wondering how I became a slime. Long story, short I died protecting my junior co-worker Tamura from a passing robber.
            </p>
            <p>
                While dying, the World Language granted me skills based on my last thoughts before death, as well as for deciding my form of reincarnation. After dying, my memories of my life got burned into my soul and I got reincarnated into a creature that best fits my new Skills and dying-wishes; a Slime.
